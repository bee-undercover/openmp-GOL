        "- You can submit your completed notebook as a Jupyter notebook through Blackboard.\n",
        "- Some parts may require you to define new python variables/functions and test your work by running cells over and over or add new cells for yourself to check/test. This is fine. Just make sure that after you have tested what you return is a clean notebook that runs smoothly and only has the output that is requested in each question.\n",
        "- Some questions rely on your work on questions before them in this exam. If you make a mistake in answering the earlier question, mark deduction for that specific mistake will not propagate in later questions that rely on that. If you cannot answer a former section at all, but you can address the latter section that relies on that, you are encouraged to write code snippet that would address that latter part with making assumptions and using hypothetical variables/input.\n",
        "- Before submission, make sure that your notebook can be executed in a single run from beginning to end. If there are questions/parts that you have left blank or incomplete, which do not allow a complete computational run to be executed, comment them out and add an explanation about your partial work in the same cell (as a python comment block).\n",
        "- Given the computational nature of this exam component and its time-criticality, do not hesitate to raise your hand if you encounter any issues.\n",
        "- All the parts that require action (either in the code or text) are flagged by `<your turn>`."
